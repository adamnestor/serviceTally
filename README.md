# ServiceTally: Service Hour Tracking for Schools

## Project Summary

This application is designed to streamline the tracking and approving of service hours within educational institutions. It caters to both students and administrators, providing distinct functionalities for each role. Students can post, view, and edit their service events, as well as check their requirement status and manage their profiles, including uploading profile photos. The application tracks the number of service hours students complete, ensuring they meet the requirements set by their respective schools.

Administrators can create and manage school profiles and service requirements, search for students by name or graduation year, and view and edit service events. They can update their own profiles, including uploading profile photos. A key feature of the application is the service event approval workflow, which allows administrators to change the status of service events to "Submitted," "Needs Attention," or "Approved." Each status change is logged in the system, providing a transparent history of the approval process.

User authentication is built into the system, ensuring secure registration, login, and logout processes for both students and administrators. Each user is associated with a specific school, making the service events and requirements contextually relevant. This association ensures that each school has a tailored set of service requirements that students must fulfill, and these requirements can be updated as needed. The application's search and filter tools assist administrators in efficiently managing and reviewing student activities. Overall, this system provides a structured and transparent way to manage service events, ensuring students meet their service requirements and administrators can effectively oversee and approve these activities.
